                    <p>The purpose of information systems varies depending on the sector a system covers, but systems generally support operations and decisions made within organizations as well as helping with data storage and facilitating management. Information systems are used by a variety of organizations in different industries. They allow companies to improve performance in certain areas by streamlining processes such as planning and organizing.

                        Information systems provide companies with internal and external benefits. Internally, they help to streamline, focus and coordinate the activities of employees and different organizational departments. In turn, companies benefit from having a more efficient workforce, which allows them to focus more time and efforts on external affairs such as marketing, sales and establishing a market presence.</p>
