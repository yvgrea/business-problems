                    <h2>GDPR</h2>
                    The GDPR refers to how personal data is collected by companied and came into effect in May 2018, 
                    for the UK it replaced the Data Protection Act of 1998, 
                    which again was a law about the processing of personal data.  
                    The GDPR is designed to encompass all 12 European member states, with a hefty fine of up to 50 million Euro, 
                    if companies do not compliant. 
                    <br>
                    The GDPR essentially came into being because of the digitising of personal data. 
                    Prior to this there was lack of consistency how companies processed and shared data, a classic example for this was the case of 
                    Cambridge Analytistics and Facebook, who used collected data to influence' America presidential election.  
                    This was an unknown quantity until the story broke.  They broke these directives and were fined accordiningly.
                    This also highlights the issue of laws necessary to protect citizens tend to lag behind the speed of the technology being developed, 
                    and the resulting collection or accessing their data.
                    <br>
                    The GDPR cruciallly includes as well as personal data like name address, email, bank details, gender, it includes health details and onces IP on one's phone and computer.
                    Companies are obliged under these directives (not laws) to tell the citizen what the data is being collected for and how it will be used.
                    With the UK leaving the UK on 30 October, it has prepared to this and will adhere to these EU directives alongside the its own DPA.
