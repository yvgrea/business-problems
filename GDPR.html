                    <p>HA DEFINITION OF GDPR (GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION)
                        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), agreed upon by the European Parliament and Council in April 2016, will replace the Data Protection Directive 95/46/ec in Spring 2018 as the primary law regulating how companies protect EU citizens' personal data. Companies that are already in compliance with the Directive must ensure that they are also compliant with the new requirements of the GDPR before it becomes effective on May 25, 2018. Companies that fail to achieve GDPR compliance before the deadline will be subject to stiff penalties and fines.
                        
                        GDPR requirements apply to each member state of the European Union, aiming to create more consistent protection of consumer and personal data across EU nations. Some of the key privacy and data protection requirements of the GDPR include:
                        
                        Requiring the consent of subjects for data processing
                        Anonymizing collected data to protect privacy
                        Providing data breach notifications
                        Safely handling the transfer of data across borders
                        Requiring certain companies to appoint a data protection officer to oversee GDPR compliance
                        Simply put, the GDPR mandates a baseline set of standards for companies that handle EU citizens’ data to better safeguard the processing and movement of citizens’ personal data.</p>
