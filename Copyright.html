                        Copyright has become a key issue since the inception of the internet in 1990.  Any information that can be digitised can easily be transferred from one location to another. In order to protect that information, by purchasing a copyright on any unique digitisable items is a way to control its distribution and also  a way to make a living.

                        <h2>History of copyright</h2>
                        
                        <i>"First law enacted 1790.
                        copyright law followed international law, extending copyright for 50 years after death of the author/creator."
                        </i>
                        <h3>How long does copyright last?</h3>
                        
                        <i>Works created on or after Jan 1978 - life of author + 70
                        Work for hire 95 years.</i>
                        <br>

                        Interestingly the IP can be the owners or the manufacturers.

                            <il>sell, </il>

                            <il>lease</il> 
                            <il>loaning copies</il>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Post it unopened, because according to dmu library
                        <i>"It is not necessary to have a notice of copyright for material to be copyright protected in the U.S.  
                        Once something tangible is produced, text, graphics, music, video, etc., it is automatically copyrighted. 
                        Sound recordings and some other property use other copyright symbols.  
                        Anyone can use the copyright symbol on her or his original work.</i>

                        <h3>The Internet and Copyright:</h3>
                        <br>
                        "The Internet has been characterized as the largest threat to copyright since its inception. 
                         
                        <b>Copyrighted works on the Net include:</b>
                        <ul>

                        In reality is that almost everything on the Net is protected by copyright law. 
                        
                        <il>links</il>
                        <il>original text</il>
                        <il>graphics</il>
                        <il>audio</il>
                        <il>video</il>
                        <il>html</il> 
                        <il>vrml</il> 
                        <il>other unique markup 
                        <br>language sequences
                        </il>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Websites and Copyright</h2>
                        <br>
Three areas to consider:
<br>
1. Making own website or app - Copyright content
<br>
2. Making for someone else - Pass on ownership of content
<br>
3. Detecting infringement by using suitable webtools like copyscape  https://www.copyscape.com/
                        
                        
                        
                
                    
            </p>
